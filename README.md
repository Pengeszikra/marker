_The minmal markdown viewer/editor_
![marker-logo-v00](./marker-logo-v00.png)

## TLDR;
Minimal functionality are included: 
A most important one is a limited HTML/JS/JSDoc/JSX syntax highlight.

Also have a special:

## Code running capabilities
```
// if after code block coding tag write ... then run it.
const dice = (side = 6) => Math.random() * side | 0;

return dice();
```

## Just past your code to `<text-box>` or free to edit.
Whole of code a pure HTML file so don't have any dependecy expect a CDN.Tailwind 
```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```
