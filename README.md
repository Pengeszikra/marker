_The ultra lightweight markdown viewer/editor_

## TLDR;
This editor and markdown viewer is heavy under construction.
A most important functionality is a limited HTML/JS/JSDoc/JSX syntax highlight.
The development process are follow the pureHTML: Whole editor is written in a single HTML
It can use without compile. 
Don't save or load data, just the good old copy/paste or hand edit mode are working.

## Bonus feature : running capabilities `don't exist in a standard markdown
```
// if after code block coding tag write ... then run it.
const dice = (side = 6) => Math.random() * side | 0;

return dice();
```

## Just past your code to `<text-box>` or free to edit.

The only dependency in code is: CDN.Tailwind 
```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```
